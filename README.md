Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Kubernetes and DevOps tools to manage and automate the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications. The goal is to ensure seamless, secure, and efficient workflows in a production environment.

Features
Kubernetes Orchestration: Automating the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications.
CI/CD Integration: Implemented Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and Ansible to maintain consistency across environments.
Containerization: Application containerization using Docker, ensuring portability and scalability.
Helm: Used Helm for templating and deploying Kubernetes applications.
Monitoring & Logging: Integrated tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for monitoring and logging.
Security: Implemented security best practices, including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and network policies within Kubernetes.
Technologies Used
Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform
Docker: Container runtime
Helm: Kubernetes package manager
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool
Ansible: Automation tool for configuration management
Jenkins: CI/CD pipeline tool
Prometheus & Grafana: Monitoring stack
Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana (ELK): Logging and analytics stack
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker
Kubernetes (Minikube, k3s, or a managed Kubernetes cluster)
Helm
Terraform
Ansible
Jenkins
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/lmunje/kubernetes_devops.git
cd kubernetes_devops
2. Deploy Kubernetes Cluster
Set up your Kubernetes cluster either locally (using Minikube) or on a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure).

bash
Copy code
minikube start
3. Install Helm Charts
Use Helm to deploy applications and services in Kubernetes.

bash
Copy code
helm install my-app ./helm/my-app
4. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline
Configure Jenkins or your preferred CI/CD tool to automatically build, test, and deploy your application to the Kubernetes cluster.

5. Monitoring and Logging
Set up monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f monitoring/prometheus-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f logging/elk-deployment.yaml
Usage
To interact with your Kubernetes cluster:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
kubectl logs <pod-name>
To scale your application:

bash
Copy code
kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/my-app
